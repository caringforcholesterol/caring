		<h1 class="food">What each Compartment looks like</h1>
		<p class="foodp">Main Compartment<br>  <br>The main Compartment is a spacious pocket with a laptop pouch for my laptop and enough room to comfortably fit a textbook and two small binders
		Inside of it. It is also tall enough to fit my pencil case, calculator, and laptop charger on top!</p>

		<p class="foodpright">Front Compartment<br>  <br>The Front Compartment is another large spacious pocket that I use to bring my gym strip/change of clothes and my lunch bag.
		It get's filled relatively quickly but it has an expansionary Compartment to be able to add more space but as previously mentioned it is very weak and can snap easily.</p>

		<p class="foodp2">Tiny Compartment<br>  <br>The Tiny Compartment is very versatile in the fact that it can hold many a things inside of it. It can hold my gum and my wallet or keys.
		It can also just hold anything of importance and value like phone chargers or small handheld gaming systems like a PS Vita</p>
