    <h1 class="title">About My Backpack</h1>
    
    <p class="titlep">This is my backpack! It is an Adidas backpack that I got a few years ago. It has 4 compartments of varienting sizes to put different things in. It also has 
        2 water bottle holders where I could put either water bottles or small umbrellas. The huge central pocket is used for my laptop, textbooks & binders and work supplies like 
        pencils, erasers, & rulers. The front pocket is used for any extra clothes I bring around and my lunch. the small top pocket is used for my keys, my wallet, and any gum packages 
        I have. and the other expansion slot at the bottom I never use because it is weak.
